Feature: Node traveling.

    Scenario: A node walks in a two dimensional plane, and move in a random manner.
        * A plane has a length and a width.
        * Node exist in a two-dimensional plane, it means each node has a pair of coordinades (e.g.[x,y]).
        * Node walks in a random direction for a random distance, without getting out of the plane's boundaries.
