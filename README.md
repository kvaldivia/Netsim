# Netsim
A simple network simulation tool.

## About
Netsim was born out of the need from a friend of mine. She was looking for a network simulator to prove
some her thesis ideas (some kind of wireless networking protocol). So she asked me to help her build a
network simulator. The project was abandoned before it could be finished because there wasn't much time 
left, and the interested parties couldn't agree on some of the features/requirements.

## Now
Netsim is a personal project now. I think there isn't really a networking simulator that helps people developing
new networking protocols in the way they need. Some tools and techniques have been developed recently, specifically
Model Checking, which is an amazing tool, but most telecomms students I know don't know about it.
